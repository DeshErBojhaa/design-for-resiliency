Recovery time objective (RTO) and recovery point objective (RPO) are two key metrics to
consider when developing a DR plan. RTO represents how many hours it takes you to return
to a working state after a disaster. RPO, which is also expressed in hours, represents
how much data you could lose when a disaster happens. For example, an RPO of 1 hour means 
that you could lose up to 1 hourâ€™s worth of data when a disaster occurs.

Minimum RTO for a single AZ outage
- 45 minutes (As response time of support 15 minutes plus(+) backup retention time period is 30 minutes.)
Minimum RTO for a single region outage
- 1 hour (On-call support staff start diagnosing issue, so approx. 30 minutes for that plus(+) backup retention and promotion of replica will cost more 30 minutes.)
Minimum RPO for a single AZ outage
- 10 minutes (because failovers are in different availability zones.)
Minimum RPO for a single region outage
- 24 hours (because usually takes place every 24 hour.)
